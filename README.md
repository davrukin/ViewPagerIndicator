Android ViewPagerIndicator
==========================

Paging indicator widgets that are compatible with the `ViewPager` from the
[Android Support Library][2] to improve discoverability of content.

Same functionality as the original project at https://github.com/JakeWharton/ViewPagerIndicator but this should build in modern projects that use Android Studio 3.0 and up.

Updated the build system to use gradle.
Updated compileSdk (26), minSdk (14), support-v4 (26.1.0)
Removed sample app for simplicity.

Usage
=====

Get it from jitpack:

  ```
  dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.splatte:ViewPagerIndicator:3.0.0'
	}
  ```
